<h3>YOU’RE GOING TO LOVE THESE BEST HOT DOG RECIPES AND SO WILL EVERYONE YOU SERVE THEM TO!</h3>
<p>Here are a few simple tips before I list our four extremely tasty creations. 
    First, we’ve crafted this post so that the ideas will work with all tastes. 
    Feel free to use traditional pork, all-beef, chicken or vegetarian wieners. You can also grill up your 
    favourite sausages too; any and all will taste divine.
    The same thing goes for the buns. Cradle your gourmet hot dogs in 
    fluffy sesame- or poppy seed-studded white buns. You can also substitute with whole wheat, Kaiser subs or a gluten-free variation. Nice Buns!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <li>water</li>
    <li>buns</li>
    <li>condiments</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the hot dogs: Preheat grill to 500°F. Using a pairing knife, cut small 45° slits along the length of the wieners, marking every half-inch and going about halfway deep. Transfer the wieners onto the hot grill and cook for about 5 minutes, turning occasionally to ensure they’re uniformly cooked. Use wieners in one or more of the following ways:</li>
    <li>For the Tex Mex: Open buns on work surface and spoon equal amounts of corn salsa onto each, spreading it out evenly. Place one cooked wiener onto each bun. Sprinkle with Monterey Jack then add slices of grilled jalapeños. Place prepared hot dogs into an oven-safe casserole or rectangular baking pan. Transfer to preheated 250°F oven and bake for 10-15 minutes or until cheese has melted and bun is toasted. Combine mayo, lime juice and cilantro and add to hot dogs as garnish. Serve immediately.</li>
    <li>For the County Fare: Open buns on work surface and line each side with pickle slices. Place one cooked wiener onto each bun. Add a helping of chili on top of each, spreading it across the hot dog. Sprinkle with cheese. Place prepared hot dogs into an oven-safe casserole or rectangular baking pan. Transfer to preheated 250°F oven and bake for 10-15 minutes or until cheese has melted and bun is toasted. Garnish with ketchup, mustard and relish. Serve immediately.</li>
